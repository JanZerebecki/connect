description: |-
  Payload to create an OEM partner order and pre-activate it on SCC API.

  The request's payload *must* contain a JSON object that *should* correspond to
  a single order.

  At the root of the main JSON object, there *must* be an unique key named
  `"partner_order"`, whose value *should* be an JSON object representing an OEM
  partner order, containing the following keys:

    - `"oem_token"`: string, **required**

      Value *must* be a string, with a maximum length of 255 characters.
      It *should not* be empty, and must be unique per OEM partner at the moment
      of placing a new order. It is generated and kept by the OEM partner.

    - `"purchased_at"`: string, **required**

      Value *must* be a string, ISO8601-formatted. It must be older than the
      current date and time (cannot be a moment in the future). It represents
      the date and time at which the customer placed the order with the OEM
      partner.

    - `"end_user_account_number"`: string, **required**

      Value *must* be a string which identifies the end user (customer) within
      the SCC domain. It *must* be either the end user's UC site ID or the end
      user's Sales Force account number. It *should* be informed by the end user
      to the OEM partner prior to placing an order to SUSE.

    - `"email"`: string, *optional*

      Value *must* be a string, email-formatted. The key-value pair *may* be
      ommited. It represents the customer's email address to be notified aboutt
      activated subscriptions.

    - `"partner_order_items"`: array of JSON objects, **required**

      Value *must* be an array of JSON objects representing the order items.
      Those objects *should* contain the following keys:

        - `"sku"`: string, **required**

          Value *must* be a string and *must* match a valid SUSE SKU.

        - `"system_limit"`: integer, **required**

          Value *must* be an integer greater than one. It represents the maximum
          number of systems which can use the given SKU simultaneously.

        - `"starts_at"`: string, *optional*

          Value *must* be a string, ISO8601-formatted. It *must* be newer than
          the current date and time (cannot be a moment in the past). It is used
          to define the start date of a SKU lifetime. If omited, the lifetime
          starts once SCC successfully activates the order item.
