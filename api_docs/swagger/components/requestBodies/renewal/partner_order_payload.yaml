  Payload to renew an existing OEM partner order on SCC API.

  The request's payload *must* contain a JSON object that *should* correspond to
  a single order.

  At the root of the main JSON object, there *must* be an unique key named
  `"partner_order"`, whose value *should* be an JSON object representing an OEM
  partner order, containing the following keys:

    - `"oem_token"`: string, **required**

      Value *must* be a string, with a maximum length of 255 characters.
      It *should not* be empty. The informed token *should* match one of an
      existing order placed by the OEM partner. This means that renewals
      *should* only be applied to existing orders whose subscriptions are active.

    - `"purchased_at"`: string, **required**

      Value *must* be a string, ISO8601-formatted. It must be older than the
      current date and time (cannot be a moment in the future). It represents
      the date and time at which the customer placed the order with the OEM
      partner.

    - `"email"`: string, *optional*

      Value *must* be a string, email-formatted. The key-value pair *may* be
      ommited. It represents the customer's email address to be notified aboutt
      activated subscriptions.

    - `"partner_order_items"`: array of JSON objects, **required**

      Value *must* be an array of JSON objects representing the order items.
      It *may* be empty if there are no items to be changed. Those objects
      *should* contain the following keys:

        - `"sku"`: string, **required**

          Value *must* be a string and *must* match a valid SUSE SKU. Renewal
          orders *should* only contain SKUs that match active subscriptions from
          the initial order.

          E.g., suppose an initial order which contains exactly the order items
          **SUSE-SKU-PRODUCT-A-1Y** and **SUSE-SKU-PRODUCT-B-1Y*,* both 1-year
          subscriptions. A renewal order *may* contain the same SKUs or SKUs
          which related to the same products, like **SUSE-SKU-PRODUCT-A-3Y**
          (3 years) or **SUSE-SKU-PRODUCT-B-5Y** (5 years), but not a SKU for a
          new subscription, like **SKU-PRODUCT-C-1Y** for product C, which is
          not included in the initial order.

        - `"system_limit"`: integer, **required**

          Value *must* be an integer greater than one. It represents the maximum
          number of systems which can use the given SKU simultaneously. It *may*
          be different from values of a previous order, meaning the system limit
          for a given SKU *may* be updated.
