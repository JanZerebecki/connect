  summary: Place a pre-activated OEM partner order
  description: |-
    This operation creates (place) an OEM partner order to SCC and request it to
    be pre-activated by the OEM partner order on behalf of the end user
    (customer).

    - Once an order is successfully created, SCC will asynchronously activates
      each item in the OEM partner order, and associates generated subscriptions
      to the end user account ("end_user_account_number"` in the request's
      payload);
    - Once subscriptions are successfully created, the end user will be notified,
      through email (`"email"` in the request's payload);
    - At this point, the OEM partner order is considerered "*redeemed*" within
      the SCC domain.

    By performing this operation, the end user *should not* perform any manual
    steps to benefit from her/his subscriptions and products.
