  summary: Renew an OEM partner order
  description: |-
    The attribute `partner_order_items` should contain only items with SKUs
    related to subscriptions created on the previous order (with the same OEM
    token). It means the endpoint can not be used to create new subscriptions,
    only to extend the lifespan of active subscriptions and/or change the system
    limits.
