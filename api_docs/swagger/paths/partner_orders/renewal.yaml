  summary: Renew an OEM partner order
  description: |-
    This operation creates (places) a OEM partner renewal order to SCC.

    The purpose of an renewal order is to renew (extend) *existing*
    subscriptions, previously generated by an pre-activated OEM partner order.

    To associate the renewal order to an initial order, the OEM partner *must*
    inform a previously used OEM token (`"oem_token"` in the request's payload).
    If the informed OEM token doesn't exist within the SCC doamin, the request
    is considered invalid.

    The attribute `"partner_order[partner_order_items]"` *should* have the same
    amount of items from the initial order, and *should* **only** contain items
    with SKUs compatible to the subscriptions created by the initial order. The
    following possible values of the array `"partner_order_items"` result in an
    invalid request:

      1. Empty array;
      2. Array containing a different amount of items from the initial order;
      3. Array containing SKUs not compatible with subscriptions from the initial
         order;

    This means the endpoint can not be used to create new subscriptions, only to
    extend the lifespan of active subscriptions and/or change the system limits.
