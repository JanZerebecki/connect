  summary: Place an OEM partner order
  description: |-
    This operation creates (places) an OEM partner order to SCC.

    - Once an order is successfully created, the OEM partner is responsible for
      informing the OEM token to the end user (customer);
    - The end user is responsible for manually activating her/his subscriptions
      through SCC using the provided OEM token.

    Until the end user perform that manual step, the OEM partner order is
    considered "*not redeemed*" within the SCC domain.
