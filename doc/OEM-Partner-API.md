The purpose of this document is to describe the way of communication between OEM partners and SUSE Customer Center API.

## Authentication

Authentication for this endpoint is performed using the SHA256 HMAC algorithm. It requires three mandatory headers:

* `Date` - current time and date of request in HTTP Date Header format (RFC 7321) - like `Tue, 06 Jul 2016 04:39:43 GMT`.

  **Important:** this header is used for prevention of repeated-request-attack. Dates older than 15 minutes will be interpreted as authentication failure.
* `Content-MD5` - Base64-encoded MD5 hash of request body (without HTTP verb and Headers) - like `xdcO0PyZn5SIAsIAI2pl7A==`. In case of `GET` requests it can be a hash of empty string.
* `Authorization` - header containing HMAC type, organization credentials and request signature - like `APIAuth-HMAC-SHA256 112233:wvSi7Ach641iUvDTVE5AEVQCwXdH0uSfUQecJTlLSIolxVmqmk7gESkUIi+65R4x6OcDNy6ytVNBbQ5hlLzBpH0V3QolvYFHRgwQqcGhcbSDrUX7nQyVREilfVJ4FYaIirBnfXWYwi9K43bXHcEWj/mBQ1A8c7vpViWpalCdf8M=`.

### Making an `Authorization` header

It consists of 3 main parts.

First part `APIAuth-HMAC-SHA256` - tells the server which algorithm is used. This value is constant, other algorithms are not accepted.

Second part `112233` - is your company's ID provided by SUSE. You can consider it as a login.

Third part is Base64-encoded SHA256-encrypted HMAC signature of the following strings, joined with commas:

* HTTP verb
* Content-Type header
* Content-MD5 header
* URL path
* Date header

For example:

`POST,application/json,xdcO0PyZn5SIAsIAI2pl7A==,/api/oem/partner_orders,Tue, 06 Jul 2016 04:39:43 GMT`

This string is then encrypted by the SHA256 HMAC using the key provided to you with the ID.

Second and third parts are connected with a colon.

### HMAC Implementations

Implementations of HMAC are linked from the footer of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code

We also have reference [implementation](OEM-API-Bash-Client.sh) in Bash
